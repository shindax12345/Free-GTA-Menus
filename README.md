Unzip the folder with Winrar

Launch gta and head to story mode 

Open the "Map" and head to "Setting" from there head to "Graphics" find "Screen Type" and make sure you have your screentype in "Windowed Borderless"

From there head to the folder kiddiosn folder and launch "modest-menu.exe"

You are done have fun modding! I recommend to use this menu as it the the safest and it has an option called rig slot machine which you can use to earn unlimited money!
